However, high severity wildfires pose a significant threat to river ecosystems and clean water supply in the Sierra Nevada. High severity wildfires destroy vegetation and alter soil properties, leading to an increase in erosion and an influx of sediment into rivers and streams. Sediment can interfere with drinking water treatment, reduce reservoir storage capacity, and harm fish and amphibians. Climate change, drought, and a century of fire suppression have caused a shift toward larger, high severity fires. Fuel treatments like prescribed fire can help reduce future fire severity by removing fuel from the forest floor. However, limited funding, staff capacity, public opinion, and arduous permitting have led to a backlog of areas in need of treatment."),

Potential benefits to water quality are generally not taken into account in planning the location of fuels reduction treatments. Forests to Faucets will design a prioritization model for locating prescribed burns in the watersheds of the Cosumnes, American, Bear, and Yuba (CABY) rivers on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. This model will prioritize sub-catchments based on the risk of erosion after a catastrophic fire, the potential of prescribed fire to mitigate that risk, treatment feasibility, and existing fuel treatment priorities."))
